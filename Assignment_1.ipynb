        "Python is popular for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Readability and Simplicity: Python's clean and simple syntax makes it easy to learn and use, making it a great choice for beginners and professionals alike. Code is more readable, reducing the complexity of writing and maintaining scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Versatile and Cross-Platform: Python is highly versatile and runs on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Django) that simplify tasks in areas such as data science, machine learning, web development, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Active Community and Support: Python has a large, active community that contributes to its development and provides abundant resources, tutorials, and third-party tools. This means a rich set of documentation and easy access to help.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Integration Capabilities: Python can easily integrate with other languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) and technologies, making it suitable for complex projects that involve multiple programming environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means code can be executed directly without compiling it first, making it great for rapid development and testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Dynamic Typing: Python handles types dynamically, meaning you donâ€™t need to declare variable types explicitly, which makes coding faster and less error-prone.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These features make Python a powerful, flexible language for a wide variety of applications."

        "Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names or function names) because they define the syntax and structure of Python programs. Each keyword serves a specific function or denotes a specific action in the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Roles of Python Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Control Flow: Keywords such as if, else, elif, for, while, break, and continue are used to control the flow of a program, including loops and conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variable Declaration and Scope: Keywords like global and nonlocal help manage the scope of variables, controlling where they can be accessed or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Function and Class Definitions: Keywords such as def, class, return, and lambda are used to define functions and classes, or return values from functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Error Handling: Keywords like try, except, finally, raise, and assert help manage exceptions and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Boolean Values: True and False are used to represent boolean values, while None is used to represent the absence of a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Logical Operations: and, or, and not are used for logical operations in conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Other Functions: Keywords like import, pass, yield, with, and async are used for module importing, generator functions, context management, and asynchronous programming.\n",
