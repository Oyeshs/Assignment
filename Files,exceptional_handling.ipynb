        "\n",
        "**1. Compiled Languages**:\n",
        "   - A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code (binary) before execution. This machine code is then executed directly by the computer's hardware.\n",
        "   - Once compiled, the program runs independently of the source code or compiler.\n",
        "   - Examples: C, C++, Rust.\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Faster execution since the program is pre-compiled; typically more optimized.\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Needs to be recompiled after every change; development process can be slower.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Interpreted Languages**:\n",
        "   - An interpreter translates and executes the source code line-by-line at runtime, without producing standalone machine code.\n",
        "   - The source code or script must be present every time the program runs.\n",
        "   - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.\n",
        "   - **Pros**: Easier for debugging and testing; more flexible and portable.\n",
        "   - **Cons**: Slower execution because the code is interpreted on-the-fly.\n"

        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to manage and respond to runtime errors or exceptions in a program. It ensures that your code can handle errors gracefully, rather than crashing the program. Python uses the `try-except` block to implement this.\n",

        "2. **`except` Block**: If an error occurs in the `try` block, the program jumps to the `except` block to handle the error. You can specify the type of exception to catch (e.g., `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`) or handle all exceptions.\n",
        "3. **Optional Blocks**:\n",
        "   - **`else`**: Executes if no exception occurs in the `try` block.\n",
        "   - **`finally`**: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs or not (e.g., for cleanup operations).\n",
