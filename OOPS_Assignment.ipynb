        "\n",
        "Ans:- The five key concepts of object oriented peogramming are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1- **Encapsulation:** The principle involves building the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called and object. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "2-**Abstraction:** Abstraction allows programmers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding the complex implementation details. It simplifies complex syatems by modeling classes based on the essentials characteristics of the objects the represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3-**Interitance:** Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class(the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class(the parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4-**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism enables a single interface to represent underlying forms(data types). It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, typically achieved through method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "5-**Classes and Objects:** At the core of OOP are classes (blueprints for creating objects) and objects(instances of classes). A class defines the properties and behaviours that its objects will have, while objects represent real-world entities."

        "\n",
        "Ans- The method resolution order in python detremines the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. It is particularly important in the context of the multiple inheritance,where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The MRO ensures that the correct method is called in a consistent and predictable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MRO Rules:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.**C3 Linearization:** Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to create a linear order of classes,ensuring that a class appears before its parent class and that the order respects the inheritance hieranchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Depth-first search:** MRO follows a depth-first approach to search for methods,prioritizing the leftmost class in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
