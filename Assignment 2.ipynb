        "2- Key Features of Lists in Python\n",
        "Lists in Python are one of the most flexible and commonly used data structures. They allow you to store multiple items in a single variable and are highly versatile.\n",
        "Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ordered- Lists are ordered collections. The order in which elements are inserted is preserved. Each element in the list has a position or index, starting from 0.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
        "print(my_list[0])\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mutable (Changeable)- Lists are mutable, which means that their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "my_list[1] = 25\n",
        "print(my_list)   # Output: [10, 25, 30]\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Indexed- Each element in a list has an associated index, which allows you to access specific elements.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
        "print(my_list[2])  # Output: 15 (Accessing the third element)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Supports Negative Indexing- Python lists support negative indexing, which means you can access elements from the end of the list by using negative indices.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
        "print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 20 (Last element)\n",
        "print(my_list[-2])  # Output: 15 (Second-to-last element)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Heterogeneous Elements- Lists can store elements of different types. This means you can store integers, strings, floats, or even other lists (nested lists) inside a single list.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [10, \"apple\", 3.14, True]\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, \"apple\", 3.14, True]\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Supports Slicing- Lists support slicing, which allows you to extract a part of the list using a specified range of indices.\n",
        "Syntax: list[start:end:step]\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
        "print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [20, 30, 40]\n",

        "In Python, dictionaries are built on a hash table structure. This allows for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions by using the keys as hash values. The immutability of dictionary keys is crucial because it ensures the integrity and reliability of the hash values, which is essential for the efficiency and correctness of the dictionary's behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Hashing and Immutable Objects**\n",
        "For a key to be used in a dictionary, it must be hashable. Hashable objects are those whose value doesn't change during their lifetime, meaning their hash value remains consistent. When you store a key-value pair in a dictionary, Python computes the hash of the key. This hash value is used to determine the index in the dictionary where the value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "If dictionary keys were mutable, their hash value could change over time, which would cause problems in retrieving or updating the values. If a key’s hash value changes after it is inserted into the dictionary, Python would not be able to reliably find the key, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. The Role of Immutability**\n",
        "Immutability guarantees that the key’s hash value will always remain the same. This is why immutable objects like strings, integers, and tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while mutable objects like lists, dictionaries, and sets cannot be used as keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings, and tuples) can safely be used as dictionary keys because their values and hash values do not change after they are created.\n",
