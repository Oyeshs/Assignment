Choosing an appropriate data type can save memory, which is especially important when dealing with large datasets.

Choosing a smaller data type can lead to significant performance gains when performing calculations, as less memory needs to be accessed and processed.

        "Broadcasting is a technique that enables NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes by automatically \"stretching\" one or both arrays to make their shapes compatible. When two arrays are not the same shape, broadcasting makes them compatible by virtually expanding the smaller array (without copying data), so that element-wise operations can be performed.\n",
